# WordleHelper
This is a program that can be used to help you find 5 letter words for wordle

## How to set up:
1. Make sure you have a version of python 3 installed
2. Make sure you have the Tkinter library (this should be installed by default, but it may not be)
- On MacOS: You may need to run the following command (if you have homebrew installed): brew install python-tk@3.9
- On Linux: You may need to install it from your package manager (either python3-tk or python3-tkinter)
3. You will need to install the enchant library (See this link for details: https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html)

## How to run:
`python3 <path to WordleHelper.py>`

You can also set a scale percentage using -s or --scale

Ex: `python3 WordleHelper.py -s 150`

(Currently 150 is the only supported value. Everything else will just use no scaling)

## How to use:
- The five boxes at the top represent the five letters in the word. Fill in the letters that you know are correct.
- The first text box under those boxes are where you can enter letters that you know are not in the word. Letters entered here will not appear in the words generated by the program
- The next text box is for letters that you know are in the word, but you don't know where in the word they are (yellow letters). The program will only generate words that contain these letters.
- Once you are done entering the info, click the "Find Words" button, and the big text box on the right will contain the possible words.
- After clicking the "Find Words" button, you can make changes to the input, and a new list of words will be generated based on the new input
